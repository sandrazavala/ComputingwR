This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## 1) Data `storms`

The data file for this lab has to do with Storms. 
The dataset is part of the `dplyr` package: `storms`.`
```{r}
storms
```
## 2) Storms in 2015

### a) Write a "dplyr" command to create a table (i.e. tibble) storms2015 containing the storms that took place in the year 2015.

```{r}
storms2015 <- filter(storms, year == 2015)
storms2015
```


### b) With storms2015, write a command that returns only the name of unique storms in 2015. In other words, the output should display only the unique names and nothing else.

```{r}
unique(pull(storms2015, name))
```


### c) With storms2015, write a command that returns a table with the name of each unique storm and the number of times it appears. In other words, this is a table with two columns: 1) name of storm, and 2) the number of counts of each storm.

```{r}
count(storms2015, name)
```


### d) With storms2015, write a command that gives you the name, month and day of the first storm recorded in 2015.

```{r}
head(select((storms2015 %>% arrange(month, day, hour)), name, month, day),1)
```


### e) With storms2015, write a command that gives you the number of hurricanes that occurred in 2015. Hint: How does a storm acquire hurricane status? (category 3+)

```{r}
count((filter(storms2015, category >= 3)))
```


### f) With storms2015, write a command that gives you the names of the hurricanes that occurred during that year. Hint: How does a storm acquire hurricane status?

```{r}
unique(pull((filter(storms2015, category >= 3)), name))
```

## 3) More manipulation
a) Use "dplyr" functions/commands to create a table (e.g. tibble) storm_names_2010s
containing columns name and year of storms recorded from 2010 to 2015. To clarify,
this table should contain only one occurrence of each storm. Use head() and tail()
to display its first 5 rows, and also its last 5 rows.

```{r}
storm_names_2010s <- distinct(select(filter(storms, year == 2010 | year == 2011 | year == 2012 | year == 2013 | year == 2014 | year == 2015), name, year))
storm_names_2010s
```

```{r}
first_five <- head(storm_names_2010s, 5)
last_five <- tail(storm_names_2010s, 5)

first_five
```


```{r}
first_five <- head(storm_names_2010s, 5)
last_five <- tail(storm_names_2010s, 5)

last_five
```

b) With the entire storms data, use "dplyr" functions/commands to create a table (or
tibble) storm_counts_per_year containing the number of unique storms in each year
(i.e. counts of storms in each year). This table should contain two columns: year values
in the first column, and the number of unique storms in the second column. Display
its last 15 rows.

```{r}
storm_counts_per_year <- count(group_by(distinct(select(storms, name, year)), year))
tail(storm_counts_per_year, 15)
```

c) With the entire storms data, use "dplyr" functions/commands to create a table
(e.g. tibble) max_wind_per_storm containing three columns: 1) year of storm, 2) name
of storm, and 3) max_wind maximum wind speed record (for that storm). Display its
first 10 rows, and also its last 10 rows

```{r}
max_wind_per_storm <- summarise(
  group_by(storms, name, year),
  max_wind = max(wind))
max_wind_per_storm
```

```{r}
first_ten <- head(max_wind_per_storm, 10)
last_ten <- tail(max_wind_per_storm, 10)

first_ten
```

```{r}
last_ten
```

##4) Some basic plots with "ggplot2"
a) Make a barchart for the number of (unique) storms in each year during the period 2010
to 2015. Make sure that the axis-label of each bar indicates the associated year. Also,
add a meaningful title to the plot.

```{r}
storm2010_15 <- filter(storms, year == 2010 | year == 2011 | year == 2012 | year == 2013 | year == 2014 | year == 2015)
uniquestorm2010_15 <- summarise(group_by(storm2010_15,year), number = n())
uniquestorm2010_15
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=uniquestorm2010_15, aes(x=factor(year), y=number)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color= "black", fill= "lightsalmon") + ggtitle('Storm Count by Year from 2010 - 2015')
```

b) Using the entire storms table, make a density graph for the variable wind, adding
color to the border line, as well as the filling color of the density curve. Also, add a
meaningful title to the plot, and choose the “Black-White” theme for the background
of the graph.

```{r}
ggplot(data=storms, aes(x=wind)) + geom_density(fill='paleturquoise4') +  ggtitle('Density of Wind for All Storms') + theme_bw() + scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

c) Make boxplots for the variable pressure of storms in each year during the period 2000
to 2011. Use facets for year (i.e. one facet per year). Also, add a meaningful title to
the plot, and choose the “Minimal” theme for the background of the graph.
```{r}
storms2000_2011 <- filter(storms, year==2000 | year==2001 | year==2002 | year==2003 | year==2004 | year==2005 | year==2006 | year==2007 | year==2008 | year==2009 | year==2010 | year==2011)
storms2000_2011
```

```{r}
ggplot(storms2000_2011,aes(x = year, y = pressure )) + facet_wrap(~year) + geom_boxplot(color= "black", fill = "cornsilk2", width= 1) + theme(panel.spacing = unit(2, "lines")) + theme_minimal()  +  ggtitle('Wind Density for All Storms')
```

d) Using the entire storms table, graph a timeline of the median wind speed by year.
That is: years in the x-axis, median wind-speed in the y-axis, timeline connecting the
dots for median wind speed in each year. Also, add a meaningful title to the plot.

```{r}
median_wind_per_year <- summarise(group_by(storms, year),
                                  median_wind = median(wind))
ggplot(median_wind_per_year, aes(x = year, y = median_wind)) +
geom_line() + 
geom_point() +
ggtitle('Median Wind Speed by Year')
```


##5) Wind Speed and Pressure
a) With the entire storms table, use "ggplot2" functions to make a scatterplot of wind
(x-axis) and pressure (y-axis). Because of the large number of dots, add an alpha
value in order to make the dots somewhat transparent. Likewise, see how to add a
“smoother” with the function stat_smooth(). Also, add a meaningful title to the plot.

```{r}

ggplot(storms, aes(x = wind, y = pressure)) + stat_smooth()  + geom_point(alpha=.3) +  ggtitle('Wind vs Pressure ')
```

b) With the entire storms table, use "ggplot2" functions to make the previous scatterplot
of wind (x-axis) and pressure (y-axis). This time don’t include a smoother; instead use
the variable category to color-code the dots in the scatterplot. Also, add a meaningful
title to the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(storms, aes(x = wind, y = pressure))  + geom_point(aes(color=category)) +
ggtitle('Wind vs Pressure')
```


##6) Storm Categories
a) Use "dplyr" functions/commands to display, in ascending order, the different (unique)
types of storm categories (using the entire storms table).

```{r}
storm_categories <- distinct(storms, category)
arrange(storm_categories)

```

b) With the entire storms table, use "dplyr" functions/commands to display a table
showing the category, avg_pressure (average pressure), and avg_wind (average wind
speed), for each type of storm category. This table should contain three columns: 1)
category, 2) avg_pressure, and 3) avg_wind.

```{r}
summarise(
  group_by (storms,category),
  avg_pressure= mean(pressure),
  avg_wind= mean(wind),
)

```

c) With the entire storms table, make a chart to visualize pressure in terms of the
different category values. For example, you can use either histograms, or density
curves, or boxplot, or violin plots. Add a meaningful title to the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(storms, aes(x= category, y=pressure)) +
  geom_boxplot(color= "black", fill= "aquamarine3", width= 0.9) +
ggtitle('Pressure Level by Storm Category')
```
